# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
Due to weak or non-existent credit records, many people have difficulty obtaining loans. Unfortunately, untrustworthy lenders frequently take advantage of this group. By delivering a pleasurable and secure borrowing experience, Home Credit aims to increase financial inclusion for the unbanked. Home Credit uses a number of alternative data, such as the person's background facts, and machine learning algorithms to forecast their clients' repayment capacity in order to ensure that this underserved demographic has a favorable loan experience. HCDR effectively offers security to the unbanked people by anticipating their ability to pay based on their history, that is, by weighing the risks of whether or not the customer would be able to repay the loan, thereby building trust and understanding between lenders and borrowers.
